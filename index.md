## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at Texas A&M University, advised by [Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me/index.html) in [FLAIR Lab](https://khhuang.me/group.html). 

Before coming to Texas A&M, I finished my master degree at Johns Hopkins University, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/).

## Research Interests

- **LCLMs Evaluation**: LLM's long-context ability is more than simple retrieval, but how can we better evaluate and understand it? 
- **Mechanistic Methods to Improve LLMs**: Can we understand long-context sequence processing internally, and how to improve it?

## News

- **[Aug. 2025]** Our paper about In-context learning: [ICL CIPHERS: Quantifying "Learning" in In-Context Learning via Substitution Ciphers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19395) is accepted to EMNLP 2025.
- **[Apr. 2025]** [Science Hierarchography: Hierarchical Organization of Science Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13834) is released on Arxiv!
- **[Aug. 2024]** Our paper about long-context problem: [Insights into LLM Long-Context Failures: When Transformers Know but Don't Tell](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.447/) is accepted to EMNLP 2024.
